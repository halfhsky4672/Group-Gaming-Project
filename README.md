# Game Jam
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
With the idea of "Reverse," we decided to make a game where the player would travel through time or recollect(it's open-ended) to piece together the events of each room. We tried to create an interactive mystery game.

## Game Play
- Objective: The player starts in a chaotic room with an interactive NPC. The player will find a portal and a door. A door leads to the present and the portals travel to the past. This was our idea of applying the idea of reverse as the player must go in reverse to ascertain the events that have unfolded.
- Game-play instructions: The player will spawn in a room with an NPC. The player is supposed to investigate each room as there are key objects scattered that have text popups to tell the story. Travel through the black portal to go back in time. Based on the objects interacted with, the player will come to their conclusions. The final room will have the portal blocked and so the player will travel through the door now. By traveling through the door in each room, the player will now experience the events in chronological order. Once back in the starting room, the player will be able to end the game by taking to the ghost NPC. There is a good and bad ending based on dialogue choices.

## Impediments
- Hardware constraints
  - Loading packages takes a long time
  - Crashes
- Repository hurdles
  - When importing assets, they would turn out incorrectly and/or be corrupted
- Time
  - As it is the final stretch of the semester, we had other classes load us up with assignments and projects

## Implementation
- Itch.io furniture assets
- 1st person player prefab from Project 5
- Unity store props
  - This is where most of the interactable props came from
- Custom Skyboxes
- Different endings
- Multiple levels

## Future Development
Potentially developed into a more fleshed-out investigative sim with puzzles maybe

# Created by: The Underachievers
Adam Wade(Menus, endings, and overall design), Skyler Halfhill(Music and sound), Ethan Hatchett(Writing), and Daniyaal Hussain(Level Design and systems design). Everybody did some programming as nobody specialized in that
